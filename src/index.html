        <p>We are always working hard to ensure your package arrives as soon as possible. Please understand that some factors like weather, high postal traffic, and the performance of shipping companies are outside of our control. We offer free shipping to most states and usually ship within 1-3 business days of payment. We do not accept P.O. Boxes unfortunately, therefore please provide a physical address. Depending on availability, some items may come from outside sources from time to time. For shipping outside of the continental USA, we use eBays Global Shipping Program. The item is shipped to eBays warehouse and then they send the item to our buyers. International customers are responsible for all duties and taxes. Please go ahead and continue to check out in order to calculate costs for shipping the item to your country. We highly recommend that messages regarding eBays Global Shipping Program are sent to eBay directly. You will be notified via eBay messages as soon as your items ship.</p>

        <p>If you need to cancel a transaction, please contact us as soon as possible and we will attempt to cancel the order. If the order has gone too far through the fulfillment process, we will be unable to cancel. In that event, you would need to wait until you receive the item and go through the normal returns process as mentioned in the returns section of our policies. Our electronic products are only designed for use within the USA and come equipped with a standard U.S. voltage plug. We cannot guarantee they will work properly elsewhere. Using an adapter or a converter is at your own risk.</p>
